If a player scores 100 runs in any given game, they are considered to have scored the game's century. Top-order batsmen are more likely to play more balls, which increases their likelihood of reaching a century. Most Centuries in International Cricket by Active Players are as below:   80: Virat Kohli (INDIA)  50: Joe Root (ENGLAND)  49: David Warner (AUSTRALIA)  47: Rohit Sharma (INDIA)  45: Kane Williamson (NEW ZEALAND)  44: Steve Smith (AUSTRALIA)  31: Babar Azam (PAKISTAN)  28: Quinton de Kock (SOUTH AFRICA)  25: Tamim Iqbal (BANGLADESH)  24: Shikhar Dhawan (INDIA)        In the history of cricket, only Sachin Tendulkar has amassed 100 centuries. With 80 centuries, Indian cricketer Virat Kohli is in second place, and Australian Ricky Ponting is in third place overall for most centuries scored. Sachin has amassed 100 centuries in his 24-year cricket career, compared to Ricky Ponting's 71 in his 17 years and Virat Kohli's 80 in his 15 years.          THE MOST HUNDREDS IN ODI HISTORY!

If a player scores 100 runs in any given game, they are considered to have scored the game's century. Top-order batsmen are more likely to play more balls, which increases their likelihood of reaching a century. Most Centuries in International Cricket by Active Players are as below:   80: Virat Kohli (INDIA)  50: Joe Root (ENGLAND)  49: David Warner (AUSTRALIA)  47: Rohit Sharma (INDIA)  45: Kane Williamson (NEW ZEALAND)  44: Steve Smith (AUSTRALIA)  31: Babar Azam (PAKISTAN)  28: Quinton de Kock (SOUTH AFRICA)  25: Tamim Iqbal (BANGLADESH)  24: Shikhar Dhawan (INDIA)        In the history of cricket, only Sachin Tendulkar has amassed 100 centuries. With 80 centuries, Indian cricketer Virat Kohli is in second place, and Australian Ricky Ponting is in third place overall for most centuries scored. Sachin has amassed 100 centuries in his 24-year cricket career, compared to Ricky Ponting's 71 in his 17 years and Virat Kohli's 80 in his 15 years.          THE MOST HUNDREDS IN ODI HISTORY!
